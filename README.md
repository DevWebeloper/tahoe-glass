# tahoe-glass

A macOS Tahoe **glass** desktop for GNOME — one script, and nothing but the
optional dependency install ever needs root.

This is a packaged version of a working desktop, not a fresh design. It installs
the [GNOME-macOS-Tahoe][tahoe] theme, the extensions that make it hold together,
a pinned dconf preset, and a set of CSS fixes that repair the parts of the theme
that were never finished — undersized text fields, buttons that render as plain
text, near-solid black popup menus, oversized quick-settings sliders, and window
controls that read as a novelty rather than a control.

```
GNOME Shell   48 · 49 · 50        (developed on 50.3)
session       Wayland preferred, X11 works with degraded blur
tested on     CachyOS (Arch family)
```

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevWebeloper/tahoe-glass.git
cd tahoe-glass
./install.sh --full
```

`--full` is the whole reference desktop — every extension and every preset —
which is what you want on a fresh machine. Plain `./install.sh` installs the
core look only and leaves the optional extensions out.

Then **log out and back in**. Extensions cannot be loaded into a running shell
on Wayland, so the top bar, the blur and the quick settings only appear on the
next session.

Have a look first if you like — nothing is written:

```bash
./install.sh --dry-run
```

### Options

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--accent COLOR` | `blue teal green yellow orange red pink purple slate` (default `pink`) |
| `--full` | the whole reference desktop — every extension and every preset |
| `--extras` | also install the rest of the reference desktop — see below |
| `--icons WHICH` | `colloid` (default, follows `--accent`) or `reversal-COLOUR` |
| `--cursors WHICH` | `adwaita` (default) or `mactahoe` |
| `--app-transparency N` | translucent app windows, `0.70`–`1.00` (default `0.92`). Off unless asked for |
| `--no-osd` | keep the stock volume/brightness popup |
| `--no-popup-blur` | keep flat translucent popups, no blur behind them |
| `--no-rounded-blur` | skip `gnome-rounded-blur` — popup blur stays static |
| `--no-bms-git` | use Blur My Shell's published build (no popup component) |
| `--no-icons` | keep your icon theme |
| `--no-cursors` | keep your cursor theme |
| `--no-wm-buttons` | keep your titlebar button layout |
| `--no-deps` | never touch the package manager |
| `--force` | reinstall things already present |
| `-y`, `--yes` | answer yes to everything |
| `-n`, `--dry-run` | print what would happen |

The accent drives the whole desktop: the shell CSS uses `-st-accent-color` and
the GTK CSS uses `@accent_bg_color`, so switching accents in **Settings →
Appearance** afterwards re-colours the toggles, sliders, focus rings and
notification titles without touching a file. Only the icon theme is pinned at
install time, and that is one flag away from being changed.

---

## What it installs

**Theme** — [kayozxo/GNOME-macOS-Tahoe][tahoe] dark, plus its libadwaita
override, pinned to a known-good commit.

**Extensions** — [User Themes][ut] (loads the shell theme),
[Blur My Shell][bms] (the actual glass), [Open Bar][ob] (top-bar geometry, menu
and notification radii), [Custom OSD][cosd] (the volume and brightness popup —
see below).

`--extras` adds the rest of the reference desktop: Just Perfection, GNOME UI
Tune, Space Bar, Auto Accent Colour, Vitals, Clipboard Indicator, ddterm,
Kiwi Menu, HotEdge, Restart To, XWayland Indicator, AppIndicator Support,
Magic Lamp Effect and Add to Steam.

Some of those may already be packaged by your distro. The installer looks in
`/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions` before it downloads anything, so those are
enabled where they are rather than shadowed by a second copy under `$HOME` that
would drift from the packaged one.

**Icons and cursors** — [Colloid][colloid] in your accent colour, installed to
`~/.local/share/icons`. Cursors are GNOME's own Adwaita by default; pass
`--cursors mactahoe` for the [MacTahoe][mactahoe] set instead.

Colloid ships a `-Light` and a `-Dark` build of every accent, but GNOME's
`icon-theme` key holds one name and knows nothing about the pair — so
switching **Settings → Appearance** to Light would restyle everything except
the icons. `tahoe-glass-icon-sync.service` watches the colour scheme and keeps
the key pointing at the matching variant.

### Popup blur

Menus, quick settings, notifications, dialogs, the alt-tab switcher and the
volume/brightness OSD all sit on a real blur.

This is why Blur My Shell is built from a pinned commit rather than taken from
extensions.gnome.org: the popup component only exists on upstream's `master`,
and no release carries it yet. When one does, this project will go back to the
published build.

There are two modes, and the difference is what the blur samples:

- **dynamic** — whatever is actually behind the popup. This is the default, and
  it needs [`gnome-rounded-blur`][roundedblur], a small C library that gives
  Blur My Shell's dynamic blur a corner mask. Without it the blur still works
  but the corners come out square.
- **static** — the wallpaper, blurred once. Needs nothing extra, and rounds its
  own corners.

The installer picks between them from Blur My Shell's own `rounded-blur-found`
key rather than assuming: library present means dynamic, absent means static.
So declining the library, or a mutter update breaking it, costs you *what the
blur samples* rather than the shape — round over the wallpaper, instead of
square over the window. Re-run `./install.sh --rounded-blur --force` to rebuild
it and the mode flips back on its own.

`gnome-rounded-blur` is the only thing this project installs outside `$HOME`,
so it is the only step that asks first — and it asks even under `--yes`. It is
compiled against your current mutter and has to be rebuilt after a mutter
update; the installer notices that case and says so.

`--no-popup-blur` reverts to the flat translucent popups this project shipped
before, exactly.

### App transparency

Blur My Shell can blur behind app windows, but libadwaita paints opaque
backgrounds, so by default there is nothing to see through. `--app-transparency`
makes the surfaces libadwaita actually paints translucent — the window, header
bar, sidebar panes, content views and popovers.

It is **off by default and not part of `--full`**, because it only works for
apps that use GTK's stylesheet. These will ignore it and stay opaque:

- Electron and Chromium apps — VS Code, Discord, Slack, Brave
- Steam, Java/Swing apps, LibreOffice
- anything drawing a GL or video surface — mpv, Totem's video widget
- XWayland apps generally, and GTK3 apps

Message dialogs and windows with server-side decorations are deliberately left
opaque: a translucent dialog is harder to read, and a translucent window under
an opaque frame reads as a rendering bug.

Any app that looks wrong can be added to Blur My Shell's per-app blacklist.

### The volume and brightness popup

Stock GNOME shows a speaker icon, the output device's name and a bar every time
you touch the volume keys. tahoe-glass drops the icon and the name and keeps
the bar, on a translucent pill with the wallpaper blurred behind it. Brightness
gets the same treatment — both go through the same shell class, so there is
only one thing to configure.

It is [Custom OSD][cosd] doing the work, so everything stays adjustable from a
window: **Extensions → Custom OSD → Settings**. Position, size, hide delay,
colours, corner radius and which parts show are all there, and the preset is
saved as its `Default` profile so the Profiles page reproduces this look rather
than reverting to upstream's.

Upstream's last release targets GNOME 46 and its last commit does not run on
50 at all — `ShellBlurEffect:sigma`, `meta_add_clutter_debug_flags()` and
`OsdWindowManager.show()`'s signature have all changed since. `patches/custom-osd-gnome50.patch`
fixes exactly those and nothing else.

The blur behind the pill, and its rounded corners, come from Blur My Shell's
popup component instead — `osd-window` is one of the surfaces it blurs. This
project used to carry its own corner shader for that job, and it was the most
fragile code here: a `Clutter.ShaderEffect` gets an offscreen buffer sized to
the actor's *paint volume* rather than its allocation, which rendered a rounded
pill on one GPU and a hard square on another. Blur My Shell's own corner effect
clamps the radius instead, so the shape comes out right without this project
maintaining a shader. The preset therefore ships `bg-effect='none'`.

Pass `--no-osd` to leave the stock popup alone.

### Custom colours

**Settings → Appearance cannot take custom swatches.** Its nine accents are
compiled into gnome-control-center; no extension can add to that list, and the
only way to change it is to patch and rebuild the app — which comes undone at
every GNOME update. Not worth it.

For arbitrary colours, use the two layers that *are* designed to be changed:

- **Open Bar → Settings** has RGB pickers for the bar, menu, highlight and
  border colours. This is where the shipped look comes from, and it can also
  derive a whole palette from the current wallpaper.
- **Auto Accent Colour** (installed with `--extras`) keeps GNOME's own accent
  tracking the wallpaper, so the parts that read the accent stay in step.

Both are GUI, and neither needs the terminal or a rebuilt package.

**A dconf preset** — the Blur My Shell pipelines and the Open Bar geometry that
this look depends on. Machine-specific keys are stripped out of the preset:
wallpaper URIs, the wallpaper-derived colour palette, monitor dimensions and
Open Bar's usage counters are all regenerated on first run.

**CSS tweaks** — three sheets, appended to the generated theme files inside a
marked block. This is the part you cannot get from any of the upstreams:

- Quick Settings sliders as macOS capsules instead of 1.6em-padded rows
- text fields with real metrics, a visible edge and an accent focus ring
- buttons that look like buttons, dropdowns that look like dropdowns
- popup menus on the same translucent material as the rest of the shell,
  with an even perimeter hairline instead of a bright top-left corner streak
- notifications that sit *on* the calendar popup rather than punching a hole
  through it, with the app name in the accent
- monochrome window controls — close is the only one that earns colour, and
  only under the pointer
- Adwaita-native switches, checks, radios and sliders, with the theme's
  1.8× knob-pop removed

Every rule carries a comment saying what upstream did and why it was changed,
so you can read `css/` and disagree with any of it.

**A Flatpak override** — read-only access to `~/.config/gtk-4.0`,
`~/.config/gtk-3.0`, `~/.local/share/themes` and `~/.local/share/icons`.
Without this a Flatpak app is sandboxed away from the GTK config and silently
keeps stock Adwaita, which looks exactly like the install having failed.

**A systemd user unit** (opt-in, `--panel-blur-fix`) — see *Panel blur* below.

---

## Where things land

Every asset installs under `$HOME`. `~/.themes`, `~/.local/share/icons` and
`~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` are ordinary writable directories that
GNOME reads exactly like the `/usr` ones, so no step scatters files into system
directories and none of them needs root.

The one dependency that is usually missing is `sassc`, which the Tahoe theme
uses to compile its SCSS. The installer prints the exact `pacman` line and asks
before running it.

This is a GNOME theme. The installer checks `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` and stops
rather than scattering files into a session that will never read them.

---

## After installing

```bash
tahoe-glass-apply     # re-apply the CSS
./uninstall.sh        # put everything back
```

Run `tahoe-glass-apply` **after any theme update**. All four CSS targets are
generated files, so re-running the theme's own installer overwrites them and
drops the tweaks. The command is idempotent — the existing block is replaced,
never stacked.

If `~/.local/bin` is not on your `PATH`:

```bash
fish_add_path ~/.local/bin                # fish
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"      # bash / zsh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Flatpak apps still look like stock Adwaita.**
They are sandboxed away from `~/.config/gtk-4.0`. The installer grants access,
but an app that was already running keeps its old style until restarted. To
check the override is there: `flatpak override --user --show`.

**A GTK app didn't change.**
GTK reads its CSS at startup. Restart the app.

**The left ~40% of the top bar has a mismatched strip after login.**
Blur My Shell builds one background actor per monitor and clips it to the
panel's geometry, which isn't settled at login — its own source notes that
`get_transformed_position` "sometimes yields NaN when the actor is not fully
positionned yet".

Only seen on multi-monitor. The fix is **on by default** and costs a 12
second wait after every login; pass `--no-panel-blur-fix` to skip it for a bug you probably
don't have. If you do see the strip, run the installer with `--panel-blur-fix`
to get `tahoe-glass-panel-blur.service`, which toggles the blur off and on once
the session has settled and rebuilds the actor against correct geometry. If the
strip survives that, your session takes longer to settle: raise the first
`sleep` in `~/.config/systemd/user/tahoe-glass-panel-blur.service`, then
`systemctl --user daemon-reload`.

Re-running the installer without `--panel-blur-fix` removes the unit again.

**Open Bar on GNOME 50.**
There is no GNOME 50 release. The installer builds it from upstream's last
commit plus `patches/openbar-gnome50.patch` — metadata, null guards, and the
GTK4/libadwaita prefs layout. On GNOME 49 and below the published build is used
unchanged. If the patch stops applying, upstream has moved and the pin in
`lib/steps.sh` needs bumping.

**The top bar font looks wrong.**
The preset asks for `SF Pro Display Bold 10`. SF Pro is Apple's, is not
redistributable, and is not installed by this project — without it fontconfig
substitutes your default sans, which is what the reference desktop does too.
Change it in Open Bar's preferences if you want something deliberate.

**The popup blur shows the wallpaper, not the window behind it.**
That is static blur, and it means `gnome-rounded-blur` is missing or has gone
stale. See *Popup blur* above; `./install.sh --rounded-blur` fixes it. The
installer says so on its own if it detects that case.

## How it fits together

```
install.sh              entry point, flag parsing, step order
lib/common.sh           output, prompting, pinned-clone and backup helpers
lib/distro.sh           distro detection and dependency install per family
lib/steps.sh            the steps themselves, with the upstream pins at the top
css/                    the CSS sheets, some installed only when asked for
dconf/core.ini          Open Bar + Blur My Shell + Custom OSD + shell theme name
dconf/extras.ini        optional extensions
patches/                the GNOME 50 patches for Open Bar and Custom OSD
systemd/                the panel blur rebuild unit
bin/tahoe-glass-apply   idempotent CSS re-apply
```

Upstream commits are pinned in `lib/steps.sh`. They are all moving targets, and
a theme that changes under the CSS is how you get a half-applied look with no
error to explain it.

---

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh                  # CSS, dconf preset, settings, systemd unit
./uninstall.sh --all            # also the extensions, theme, icons and cursors
```

The installer only ever appends to generated files inside a marked block, and
keeps a first-run copy of anything it overwrites in
`~/.config/tahoe-glass/backups`. Extensions are left installed unless you ask,
because removing one also throws away its settings.

Take your own snapshot first if you have a desktop worth keeping:

```bash
dconf dump / > ~/dconf-backup.ini      # restore with: dconf load / < ~/dconf-backup.ini
```
